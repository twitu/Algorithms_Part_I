# Algorithms_Part_I
Code for programming assignments in Algorithms part 1 by Princeton.  
All the material for the course is free and available online at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/).  
The course consists of 5 programming assignments, each targetting a specific data structure or algorithm and it's real world application. To complete an assignment you require a score above 80% on automated tests.

## Week 1: [Percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)
Using Quick Union, Quick Find to compute if water percolates through a grid given the blockages and open cells.  
_Completed:_ 82%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Check for backwash

## Week 2: [Queue](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html)
Implementing a double-ended queue and a randomized queue using sorting algorithms.  
_Completed:_ 84%  
_Features to implement:_ NA  

## Week 3: [Collinear](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html)
Given a set of random points finding the line segments containing 4 or more collinear points.  
_Completed:_ 80%  
_Features to implement:_ NA  

## Week 4: [8puzzle](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html)
Solving an 8puzzle game using priority queue and A* search algorithm.  
_Completed:_93%  
_Features to implement:_ NA  

## Week 5: [Kdtree](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html)
Given a set of random points use kd-trees to find nearest neighbour and all points in a given range.  
_Completed:_88%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Corner cases in nearest neghbour search. Points in opposite branch of kd-tree are closer.

## Comment:
I find this course well-designed and rewarding. The videos are precise and programming assignments are great fun to solve. My favorite is the 8puzzle solver particularly because it requires a tricky inner class implementation for the priority queue to work.
